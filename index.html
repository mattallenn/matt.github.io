        <h3>Interests</h3>
        <p>
         Jack of all trades, master of none (is often better than a master of one?) 
         describes me pretty well. I partake in way too many hobbies. Some of these include:
         <br>
         <br>
         <i>
            Drumming
         </i> - I've been drumming on and off for most of my life. More recently, I've joined a
         band and have begun taking it a bit more seriously.
         <br>
         <br>
         <i>Snowboarding</i> - I Absolutely love snowboarding. Unfortunately I only get to go a couple times
         per season. The midwest is suboptimal (sucks ass) for winter sports!
         <br>
         <br>
         <i>Building</i> - If it's buildable, I'd rather build it. Whether that be software, woodworking,
         welding, or anything else that involves creating. Wrenching on stuff and making useless shit is 
         one of my favorite pasttimes.
         <br>
         <br>
         <i>Linux</i> - I'm a big advocate for Linux and FOSS software in general. Currently running Pop!_OS and Fedora,
         but have also used Arch (btw), Ubuntu, and a few other distros.
