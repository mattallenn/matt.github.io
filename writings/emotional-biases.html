                Emotional Bias: Influence of emotions on one's thoughts and decision making, which can lead to subjective and irrational decisions and judgements.
                Common emotional biases:
                <br>
                <br>
                1. <b>Anchoring bias</b>: Being influenced by the first piece of information you've encountered
                <br>
                <br>
                2. <b>Confirmation bias</b>: Seeking for information that aligns and confirms with preexisting beliefs.
                <br>
                <br>
                3. <b>Empaty gap bias</b>: Making a decision without considering how we will feel in the future
                <br>
                <br>
                4. <b>Endowment effect</b>: Assigning something more value than it actually has because we own it.
                <br>
                <br>
                5. <b>Focusing effect</b>: Focusing too heavily on one aspect of a situation while ignoring others.
                <br>
                <br>
                6. <b>Framing effect</b>: Choices Influenced by the way information is presented, not the information itself.
