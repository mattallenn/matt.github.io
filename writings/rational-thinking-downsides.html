                Thinking too rationally can have some issues. It's important to note, however, that rationality in itself is somewhat subjective. 
                <br>
                <br>

Lots of the big decisions and events in life are complex. Trying to think through these things and solve them rationally can be good, but it's imporant to note that logic and rationale is not the only thing at play. Emotions, which are the root of how we actually feel, also play a massive role in these events. If you attempt to tackle these events with solely logic, then you're not being rational in the first place. 

It can be difficult for people to recognize and accept this, but consider this: Would you rather live the life that is emotionally fulfilling, or the life that is based solely on logic? For me, the former is the obvious pick. Keep in mind that striving for an emotionally fulfilling life does not mean that it's any less rational.

                <br>
<br>
Analyzing our emotions truthfully is a whole other topic, but heres a good rule of thumb.
	When making a decision, or thinking about something in general, how does it make you feel?
	Nervous? Excited? Scared? Unsure? Unpleasant? Comfortable?
